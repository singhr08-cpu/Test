    "To determine feasibility, we must first decide how to model the water and land requirements. A few thoughts: \n",
    " - For **water**, the requirements are listed for both a seedling and a mature tree. Presumably, if we don't give enough water to a seedling, its growth would be impacted. So we should make sure that we have enough water to support seedling and also mature trees. Because there are always more seedlings than mature trees (because some seedlings do not survive), **we can simply write our water requirement for seedlings**.\n",
    " - For **land**, the requirement is listed for mature trees. One option is to just igore what is happening with seedlings and calculate the land requirement for mature trees, by taking the survival rate into account. However, in this case, if all the seedlings we planted were to mature, they would not have enough land available! So a more conservative requirement is to ensure that we have enough land even if all the planted seedlings become mature. (That calculation would ignore the survival rate.) **Subsequently, we adopt the more conservative requirement: we require that enough land should be available to support all planted seedlings as if they all survive to be mature.**\n",
    "\n",
    "The comparisons we need to make then are:\n",
    " - **land**: is the total land used by **mature trees** -- <font color=red>**assuming that all planted seedlings survive**</font> -- exceeding the land available?\n",
    " - **water**: is the total water used by **seedlings** exceeding the land available? \n",
    " - **cost**: is the total cost exceeding the budget available?"
